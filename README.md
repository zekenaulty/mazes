# mazes

Brushing up on algorithms, mazes, and canvas using javascript.

As a self taught programmer, I've read at least 200+ books on writing code,
but the thing that I always felt I fell short on was: algorithms and big o notation.

I've started tinkering with this again, but have decided to go pure javascript. No frameworks, no jquery, etc. etc.
