# mazes

Brushing up on algorithms, mazes, and canvas using javascript.

As a self taught programmer, I've read at least 200+ books on writing code,
but the thing that I always felt I fell short on was: algorithms and big o notation.

Some programmers/developers will say that isn't a very big problem, and it really isn't.
Most applications don't require tuning to the level that a deep knowledge of big o and algorithms
would matter and these days most toolkits provide "good enough" sorting and searching tools.
Even javascript has tools like underscorejs to help with these things.
Not to mention the constant increase in computing power.

Thats nice, but I know for a fact, the more you understand the better quality code you create.

I am using somewhat out dated tools, but I also plan to create a version 2 where I use TypeScript etc.
